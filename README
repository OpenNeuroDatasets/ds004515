RL task in N=54 Community participants.  Data collected from 2019-2021 in the CRCL at UNM.  The paper [Singh, G., Campbell, E., Hogeveen, J; Witkiewitz,K., Claus, E.D., & Cavanagh, J.F.  Alcohol Imagery Boosts The Reward Positivity in Heavy Drinkers]  Should be coming out in Psychophysiology.  Your best bet for understanding this task  would be to read that paper first.  - James F Cavanagh 08/02/2022
